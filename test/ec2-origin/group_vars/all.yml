# cluster_job: in case you want to want to run this more than once, for idempotency, leave this the same
# but if you want to create an entirely new cluster after you've already created a "1" cluster,
# then change this to "2" and it will make a whole new cluster and vpc. In practice, we just  
# append this to the VPC and instance names.
